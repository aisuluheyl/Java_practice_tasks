/*
SWITCH:
12. Create a class named NumberOfDays. An integer variable named month is given.
	Write a program to determine the number of days in a given month.

			Example:
				   month = 5

			Output:
				   31 days

			(Assume that February has 28 days)

		If the given month number is not between 1~12, then print "Invalid."

		Hints:
			Months with 31 days: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12
			Months with 30 days: 4, 6, 9, 11
